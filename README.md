This repository contains my implementation of useful data structures, algorithms, 
games, as well as my solutions to programming puzzles. 

Each item is marked with a difficulty level.
1 - easy
2 - medium
3 - hard

If a file name starts with 'lc', it's a problem from leetcode.com

Written in python3. Thanks Danijar Hafner (@danijar) for the inspiration.
